		<h2>Cities I've Lived In</h2>
		<h5>I was born in Boulder, moved to Westminster where I grew up, then back to Boulder for college. I lived in San Francisco for an internship in Fall 2013.</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Boulder<span>&#223;</span></li>
			<li>Westminster<span>&#216;</span></li>
			<li>San Francisco<span>&#8482;</span></li>
		</ul>

			

		<h2>Cities I want to visit.</h2>
		<H5>I want to visit Austin because I love Boulder, and I hear that Austin is "weird" like Boulder. Tokyo because it just seems so crazy and outlandish, and Nashville because it's the heart of a lot of important things.</H5>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Austin, TX<span>&#170;</span></strong></li>
			<li><em>Tokyo, Japan<span>&#165;</span></em></li>
			<li><strong>Nashville, TN<span>&#162;</span></strong></li>
		</ol>
